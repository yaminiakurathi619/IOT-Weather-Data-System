# IoT‑Based Weather Data System Using ESP32

This project is a real-time weather monitoring system built using an **ESP32 microcontroller** and multiple sensors (DHT22, BMP280, rain gauge, anemometer). The system collects temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and rainfall data, which is sent to the **ThingSpeak cloud platform** for real-time visualization.

## Tools & Technologies
- ESP32 microcontroller
- DHT22, BMP280, Rain Gauge, Anemometer
- ThingSpeak Cloud Platform
- Wi‑Fi data transmission

## Live Dashboard
